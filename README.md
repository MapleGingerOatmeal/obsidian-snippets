# Obsidian CSS Snippets

This repository is a personal collection of CSS snippets that I use to customize the appearance of my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault.

Most of these snippets are original creations, but some have been adapted from or inspired by the work of others in the Obsidian community. In cases where code is not my own, credit is always given within the comments of the respective CSS file. These snippets are all intended to be compatible with the default Obsidian theme.

## How to Use

To use any of these snippets in your own vault:

1. Navigate to your Obsidian vault's configuration folder, i.e. the `.obsidian` folder within your vault's root directory.
2. Inside the `.obsidian` folder, create a new folder named `snippets` if it doesn't already exist.
3. Download or copy the `.css` file for any snippet you wish to use and place it inside the `snippets` folder.
4. Open Obsidian and go to **Settings** â†’ **Appearance** and scroll down to the **CSS snippets** section, where you should see the snippets you added listed here.
5. Find the newly created snippet and toggle its switch into the on position to enable it. You may need to refresh any currently open views to see the changes applied.

## Disclaimer

These snippets are designed for my specific workflow and configuration. While the majority of these styles should be compatible with standard setups, they are provided as-is, and you may need to modify them to suit your own configuration. Use at your own risk.
